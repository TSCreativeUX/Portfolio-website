           <h2> Project Overview </h2>
            <p> The goal was to create an app that allows users to connect instantly with an Expert in virtually any field.
              The challange was to creat an app which the expert indeed had experience in that field.
              My role as a UX Designer included user research, usability testing and designing the application from scratch</p>
